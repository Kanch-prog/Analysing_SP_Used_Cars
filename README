                                                              Data Loading and Preparation:

This was followed in the tutorial https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/analyzing-selling-price-of-used-cars-using-python/?ref=lbp and the dataset was provided by https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/autos/imports-85.data

1.Load the dataset and assign meaningful column names.
Reason: Prepare the data for analysis by ensuring it is correctly formatted and labeled.
Identifying Missing Values:

2. Check for missing values in the dataset.
Reason: Identify any gaps in the data that need to be addressed to ensure accurate analysis.
Converting Units:

3. Convert city MPG to liters per 100 kilometers (L/100km).
Reason: Standardize units for better interpretability and comparison.
Handling Missing Values and Data Types:

4. Remove rows with missing price data and convert price from string to integer.
Reason: Ensure that the price column is in a suitable format for numerical analysis.
Normalizing Values:

5. Normalize length, width, and height.
Reason: Scale the features to a range of [0,1] to facilitate comparison and analysis.
Binning Prices:

6. Bin prices into categories (Low, Medium, High).
Reason: Group continuous price values into discrete categories for categorical analysis and visualization.
Converting Categorical to Numerical Variables:

7. Use one-hot encoding for categorical variables (e.g., fuel type).
Reason: Transform categorical variables into a format suitable for numerical analysis and machine learning models.
Visualizing Price Distributions:

8. Create boxplots to visualize the distribution of prices and their relationship with categorical variables (e.g., drive wheels).
Reason: Understand the spread and central tendency of price data, and identify any outliers or patterns.
Analyzing Relationships with Scatter Plots:

9. Plot scatter plots and regression lines for features like engine size vs. price.
Reason: Visualize and quantify the relationship between numerical features and price.
Grouping and Pivot Tables:

10. Group data by categorical variables and create pivot tables.
Reason: Summarize data to identify patterns and relationships between categorical variables and price.
Heatmaps:

11. Create heatmaps to visualize the summarized data from pivot tables.
Reason: Provide a visual representation of how different combinations of categorical variables affect price.
ANOVA Analysis:

12. Perform ANOVA to test the significance of categorical variables (e.g., make) on price.
Reason: Determine if there are statistically significant differences in prices between different groups.
Correlation Analysis:

13. Use regression plots to analyze the correlation between numerical features (e.g., engine size) and price.
Reason: Identify and quantify the strength of relationships between features and price.

    What features of cars affect their prices?
    
    Answered by: ANOVA analysis, scatter plots, boxplots, heatmaps.
